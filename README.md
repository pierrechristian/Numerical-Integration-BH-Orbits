# Black Hole Orbits and Numerical Integrations
This is a Jupyter notebook designed for students who are interested in learning basic numerical integration techniques. In this notebook, we will build a numerical integration code in a step-by-step manner, and employ it to solve the motion of particles around black-holes.
